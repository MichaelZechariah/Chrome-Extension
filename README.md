
Background color changer

My final project is a Chrome extension using JavaScript called Background color changer.
Background color changer is a Chrome extension that changes the background color of most websites such as (Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Twitter, Twitch, Microsoft, eBay , WhatsApp and the most important sites edx.org and cs50.harvard.edu) 
Background color changer consists of two pages
1- Popup: - It is the page that appears when clicking on the extension icon and it contains a colored button (the default color when installing is white) and this button, when clicked, changes the background color of the web page to the same color as the button
2- Options: - This page appears when you click the right mouse button on the extension icon and choose options, and on this page a colored button appears (the default color when installing is white)
When you click on it, a palette of colors appears, then we choose the color we want, and the color of the button changes to the color we chose Then we click on the button and the color of the button on the Pop Up page changes to the color we chose


I uploaded two copies to the project
1- Background Color Changer.crx: - It is a ready-to-be-published version on the Chrome Web Store
2- A folder called Background Color Changer: - It shows the files used in the implementation of the project, and through it the extension can also be installed on the Google Chrome browser by entering chrome://extensions/ then choosing load unpacked and choosing the Background Color Changer folder


Thank you very much CS50
